With the help of my professor, Daniel Card, I got it fully functional and hosted on GitHub pages. Process Overview The most difficult part of making this website for me was setting up MkDocs and Python. While these are both open source and free, it took some work to make them fully functional. We used the MkDocs documentation to help us work through the process, and we also had to use the command line to build our MkDocs site. After setting up MkDocs, we could freely create and host websites, but only for brief periods of time. To fully host our websites, we had to use GitHub pages. We used the command line to build our MkDocs website, and then pushed the changes to GitHub and published them using GitHub pages. The end result was a hosted website that we could quickly modify on our computer and that was public to everyone. 1.
