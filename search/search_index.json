Many of these projects involved combining technical skills with complex theories. While most of what I feature here relates to school, I had a lot of fun with most of these and enjoyed using my creative liberty with them! Static Site v1 The Static Site v1 was the first website I have ever created outside of a Content Management System (CMS). It is hand-coded HTML and CSS, which means that it does look like something out of the 1990's. However, this assignment taught me a lot. It was fun to learn about HTML and CSS, and it helped to have some previous coding experience. The most important part about the Static Site v1 is that it was my first \"portfolio site\", so a lot of content on this website takes inspiration from the Static Site project! Here is the link to my static site: Static Site v1 . Structured Authoring with DITA The second website-related project I worked on was the structured authoring using DITA. I did not directly code a website in this project; rather, I used the Oxygen software to organize DITA files and transform them into various forms of documentation. I sought to make some documentation about creating a D&D character, with the idea that it would be part of a larger documentation, such as a player handbook or other tutorial-related material. After I made the separate DITA files and added content to them, I could use Oxygen to transform the DITA files into multiple forms. One of these forms was a website, and the other was a PDF.

With the help of my professor, Daniel Card, I got it fully functional and hosted on GitHub pages. Process Overview The most difficult part of making this website for me was setting up MkDocs and Python. While these are both open source and free, it took some work to make them fully functional. We used the MkDocs documentation to help us work through the process, and we also had to use the command line to build our MkDocs site. After setting up MkDocs, we could freely create and host websites, but only for brief periods of time. To fully host our websites, we had to use GitHub pages. We used the command line to build our MkDocs website, and then pushed the changes to GitHub and published them using GitHub pages. The end result was a hosted website that we could quickly modify on our computer and that was public to everyone. 1. Installing MkDocs and Python First, we installed Python. Python allowed us to use MkDocs to build a site, so having one but not the other was no help. To do this, we retrieved the latest version from the Python website . Next, we had to install pip. Using the command line, we simply entered: python get-pip.py After that, we installed mkdocs by entering: pip install mkdocs 2. Building the Website After getting the initial steps set up, we could start making Markdown files in our project and editing them. Of course, we had to organize these files so that MkDocs would use them when building the website. To do this, we made a large folder: my-mkdocs . This contained: A folder docs for Markdown files. A folder site for the build website. A file mkdocs.yml which contained the information for organizing the site. After editing the initial Markdown files like index.md and about.md , we could make our first build of the site. To build the website, we had to enter the command line interface once again. There were three steps to building the site. Enter cd desktop to go to the desktop files. Enter cd my-mkdocs to enter the MkDocs files. Enter mkdocs build to build the website, which is stored in the site folder. To view the website, there were three more steps to take. Enter mkdocs serve to host the website. Copy the link that the command line gives to you. Paste the link in a browser URL. This allowed us to temporarily view the website, but it would stop hosting as soon as we exited the command line. This meant that we had to use a more efficient way of hosting the website: GitHub Pages. 3. Using GitHub Pages Setting up GitHub Pages meant we could now freely host the website and make changes a lot more quickly and efficiently. We followed a few steps to link our website to GitHub Pages. Install GitHub desktop. Make a new local repository. Use the name \"site\" to link with our site file. Use the main and root branches. Keep the repository public. After creating the repository, we could now keep track of any changes we made by building the site folder. First, we had to host the site. We enterd GitHub broswer to publish the first commit of the website and keep it public. When we changed the folder by using mkdocs build in the command line, we could now follow a couple more steps to change the website. Enter GitHub desktop. Select the current project (site). Look over changes. Add a summary of changes. Select \"Commit to main\". Select \"Push to origin\". After doing these, we could now enter GitHub browser mode to view the latest deployment of the website. Overall, this was a very long process, but it was very rewarding to get to see our website hosted and successful after the long time it took to set up!","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"max/#website-documentation","text":"I built this website in WRIT 4662W using MkDocs and Markdown.

I underwent many difficulties and challenges, but I never felt frustrated by the lack of immediate success. Rather, I accepted these challenges and worked through them in a procedural way. My ability to use digital technology as a creative outlet expanded, but I also learned how to put my skills to other uses. After experimenting and practicing with HTML, WordPress, DITA, and Markdown, I grew much less intimidated of digital technology and found myself enjoying the work with digital technology instead of dreading it. Creativity and Digital Technology In my original Digital Literacy Narrative assignment, I elaborated about how I grew up using digital technology as a way to express creativity. With the tools I used and knowledge I gained, I can safely say that I have continued to express creativity with digital technology, and I plan to do this even more in the future. For my DITA assignment, I used a more \u201ccreative\u201d Dungeons & Dragons tutorial as inspiration for my project. Taking this perspective on the project allowed me to see ways in which I could use DITA documentation for other creative purposes, such as setting up the background for a Dungeons & Dragons campaign. However, I also gained insight as to how I could use digital technology outside of a creative/artistic scope. Professional Uses Learning about digital technology and adapting to various forms of it helped me see a lot of areas where digital technology connects with technical communication. In this way, my digital literacy evolved into a more applicable form. The different types of documentation tools especially stood out to me as ways that I could organize information in a professional career working as a technical communicator. I also was very excited to find out that the tools we use are also popular among the majority of technical communicators. While I did not master any of these tools, I was able to adapt to them quickly and effectively in a way that allowed me to efficiently complete useful tasks. In a sense, I think that this is more useful to me than mastering HTML and CSS, for instance. Since HTML and CSS only make up one part of technical communication, I would not want to spend all my time using those tools, nor would it help me. Instead, I\u2019ve learned throughout the course that quickly adapting to new technologies is key for technical communicators who frequently have to pick up new content and methods. What Comes Next? I\u2019ve learned a lot of ways to apply my new digital technology skills, and I will use my lessons from this course to expand on and further apply these skills in the future. I think that these skills would make me a more competitive candidate in the technical communication field, and I likely will have to use them once I enter this field. When I do enter the field, it could also be the case that I have to learn new digital technologies outside of what we explored in class. In this case, I would use my methods and takeaways from this course to guide me through that process. In the nearer future, I can see a lot of things we learned in the class connecting to my courses in computer science. Since I will have to learn different languages such as Java, Python, and C, I will use the new strategies from this class to guide those processes as well. Whatever happens next, I know that my lessons from this class will help me. Thanks to the class, I have become much less intimidated with the digital technology landscape and have begun to actively seek out opportunities where I can learn more about the tech world. My digital literacy evolved in a fundamental way, and I am excited to see how my relationship with digital technology will grow in the future.","title":"Digital Literacy Narrative"},{"location":"narrative/#digital-literacy-narrative-v2","text":"Throughout this course and my journey with digital technologies, I learned a lot of valuable lessons.

Almost every aspect of the course helped me in some way, and looking back, I saw myself grow quite a bit this semester. By reflecting on my relationship to digital technology and then expanding on my knowledge, I feel much more prepared to use my existing knowledge and gain new knowledge about digital technology in a future setting, whether that\u2019s school or career based. Ultimately, this was one of the most useful classes for my education in technical communication. Strategies I developed many new strategies for developing my skills with digital technology and technical communication as a whole. Specifically, I learned that gaining a base knowledge of the technology and then testing and playing with the technology is really beneficial to my learning. To summarize and illustrate my strategy for learning new digital technologies, I have created a sort of \u201calgorithm\u201d that I use. Set up the new technology \u2013 install, create environment, etc. Gain a basic understanding of how to use the technology. Test some elements and features. Come up with something that I want to create. Try to create that thing using the technology. Repeat when I have created something and want to learn more. I feel like this algorithm helped me learn new digital technology because I was always motivated to explore new things that relate to me, and so I was always passionate about reaching my exploration-based goals. I also found that unlike CMS technologies, the different tools we used in class had few limitations \u2013 the challenge came in learning how to use the technology to achieve your goal. Using a testing and tinkering period and switching over to a goal or objective really helped me explore many aspects of the technology we used and how I could use them to my advantage. I\u2019ve also expanded this algorithm beyond this class; for other technologies like programming languages, I have used a similar method to learn new things. Without this class, I would not have learned how to create such a helpful method for myself, so I am very happy with how my learning strategy developed this semester. Key Takeaways I feel like my ability to grasp complicated concepts grew a lot this semester, to the point where I have been able to do so very quickly. In a technical communication setting, this is extremely important because we are often met with new, complex information that we have to work with. From a personal standpoint, this is also valuable. I now have a lot more artistic tools when I engage in my hobbies, and I also have a stronger ability to learn about new tools and explore. I like that I have broadened my horizons for both my schoolwork/career capabilities and my creative hobbies because I feel that a new dimension of the world has opened up for me when I previously didn\u2019t know much about it. I elaborated a bit about this in my digital literacy narrative, but this semester I had the goal of learning more about technology, specifically programming and computers. What I achieved far exceeds this goal, as I have learned about these things and applied them to my interests, but now I am excited to learn even more. To me this is the biggest victory of the semester. I not only learned about digital technology, but I have also gained a strong knowledge base, a set of strategies, and a deep interest in the subject.","title":"Course Reflection"},{"location":"reflection/#course-reflection","text":"In this course, I was able to learn a lot of things about myself and about digital technology.
